# ElodeaIsotopes
Project assessing the food web impacts of invasive Elodea canadensis on wetland food webs in the Copper River Delta of Alaska

# Folder Guide:
The files are organized so that the code, data, and figures are all grouped together in sub-folders so that everything is mostly organized here

# Steps to Analysis
Make some base exploratory plots of the SI data from the 6 study ponds -- One with raw data values all plotted -- One with mean +/- standard deviation for each taxa

Conduct analysis of Layman metrics

Conduct mixing models for consumption assessment
